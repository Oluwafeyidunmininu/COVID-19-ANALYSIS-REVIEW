# üåç COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

## üßæ Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive 2019 global impact analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on key indicators such as infection rates, death counts, vaccination rates, and the percentage of population vaccinated. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights from global data and support further analysis.

---

## üéØ Aim

- To identify countries with disproportionately high infection rates relative to population size  
- To examine countries with the highest death counts by population  
- To determine the continent with the highest death count per population  
- To investigate the relationship between total population and vaccination rates  
- To calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated  

---

## üìÇ Data Source

- [Our World in Data ‚Äì COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

---

## üí° Derivable Insights

- Countries with highest infection rates per population  
- Countries with highest death counts per population  
- Continent with highest death count per population  
- Relationship between total population and vaccination rates  
- Percentage of population vaccinated

## üìå Summary of Key Findings

### 1. Countries with Disproportionately High Infection Rates Relative to Population Size

- **Andorra**: 415,656 infections, population under 80,000  
- **Gibraltar**: 272,582 cases, population ~34,000  
- **Others**: San Marino, Isle of Man, Martinique

**üîç Insight**: Small population sizes amplified per capita infection rates in European microstates.

---

### 2. Countries with the Highest Death Counts by Population

- **Hungary**: 49,053 deaths (~9.6M people)  
- **Czechia**: 43,509 deaths (~10.5M people)  
- **Bulgaria**: 38,700 deaths (~6.5M people)  
- **Peru**: Known globally for the highest per capita death rate (not in current dataset)

**üîç Insight**: Aging populations and limited hospital capacity were key mortality drivers.

---

### 3. Continent with the Highest Death Rate per Population

**Total Deaths**:  
- **South America**: 702,116 (~430M people)  
- **Europe**: 2,102,483 (~750M people)  
- **Africa**: 259,117 (~1.4B people)  

**Death Rate per 100,000 People** (approximate):  
- South America: ~163  
- Europe: ~280  
- Africa: ~19  

**üîç Insight**: South America had a higher death rate per capita than even Europe.

---

### 4. Population vs. COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

- **India**: 1.27B population, 533,623 deaths ‚Äì relatively low per capita death rate  
- **Brazil**: 1.69B cumulative cases, 702,116 deaths ‚Äì high death toll  
- **USA**: High-population country also saw high mortality (data not detailed here)

**üîç Observation**: High population does **not** directly result in high death or case rates. **Healthcare quality** and **vaccine rollout** mattered more.

---

### 5. Vaccination Coverage ‚Äì Percentage of Population Vaccinated

**High-Income Countries**:
- **Canada**: 114.5M doses (~300% of population ‚Äì suggests multiple doses)  
- **Germany**: 380.7M doses (~4.5x population)

**Low-Income Countries**:
- **DR Congo**: 3.57M vaccinated (~4%)  
- **Burundi**: Only 35,030 doses for over 12M people

**üîç Insight**: Massive global inequality in vaccine distribution, with high-income nations exceeding 70% coverage, while low-income nations barely reached 10‚Äì20%.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- Small European countries had the highest **infection rates per capita**  
- Eastern Europe and South America had the highest **death rates relative to population**  
- **South America** had the highest **death rate per capita by continent**  
- **Population size** was not a strong predictor of infection or death rates  
- **Healthcare systems** and **vaccine access** were key drivers of COVID-19 outcomes  
- **Vaccination coverage** was extremely uneven globally
